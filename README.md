# JSON Parsing Tutorial Source Code

This project contains the full source code used in my JSON Parsing tutorial.

## History

Originally, this repository was a playground for myself to learn Rust and to try to learn how to parse JSON. I had set it up to have two separate parsers, one written in a procedural / recursive descent style and another written using parser combinators.

Later, I decided it would be fun to write a tutorial, so I deleted everything except the procedural style and slimmed it down to just the features that I wanted to show.

I may write another tutorial in the future on using the combinator style and add the source code here.
