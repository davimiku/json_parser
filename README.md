# JSON Parser

This project contains a basic parser for JSON data for academic use to learn Rust and the basics of lexers/parsers.

## Items yet to implement

- [x] Parsing negative integers
- [ ] Parsing of floats
- [ ] Process escape characters in strings
- [ ] Robust and complete error handling

## Enhancements / "nice to have"

- [ ] Allow trailing commas as an opt-in feature
- [ ] Allow `//` style comments (jsonc)
