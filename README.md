# JSON Parser

This project contains a basic parser for JSON data for academic use to learn Rust and the basics of lexers/parsers.

## Items yet to implement

- [ ] Parsing of numbers into the appropriate int/float type
- [ ] Process escape characters in strings
- [ ] Experiment with returning "nicer" errors with full explanations for invalid JSON data

## Enhancements / "nice to have"

- [ ] Allow trailing commas as an opt-in feature
- [ ] Allow `//` style comments (jsonc)
- [ ] Experiment with more efficient serialization
